  <p>Websites are crucial to the development and growth of every company. A lot of smaller businesses and start-ups
    believe they can’t afford to host and build a website and therefore wait until they grow to create a website.
    However, we at Lucidica believe that in this day and age, it is imperative that all businesses have a website and
    that actually it can be challenging to grow a company without that online presence. </p>
  <p>We understand that currently there are two choices when you look at creating a website. You can either create it
    yourself using Squarespace or Wix at a low cost, allowing you to have that online presence without a huge project
    cost or you can pay a web developer thousands of pounds to design, develop and support your website. We see issues
    with both of these choices; the first is time costly and the second can easily become very expensive. </p>
  <p>At Lucidica, we wanted to solve this problem by creating websites that clients can edit and update themselves at
    a low cost. We give you consultancy on what works best and generates the most leads and can set-up this website
    for you at an affordable cost with payment plans if a project cost doesn’t work for your company. </p>

<h1 class="heading" id="hosting">Hosting</h1>

<section class="section section-item section__webdev">
  <p>Hosting your website really simply means paying for your website to be online. A large misconception with hosting
    is that includes back-up, security and maintenance of a website when really hosting only includes your website being
    live and accessible on the internet. </p>
  <p>We offer two hosting packages; standard hosting and super hosting. </p>


  <div class="offers-wrapper">
    <div class="offers-compare">
      <div class="offer">
        <div class="heading silver"></div>
        <div class="title">Standard hosting</div>
        <p>Standard hosting is the cheaper option where the hosting is managed by us but on a shared server so can be slightly slower. This hosting is for companies who don’t get a huge amount of traffic but want to have an online presence. It’s a good starting point for a companies first website.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Website control panel (add accounts, reset passwords etc yourself)</li>
          <li>Migration - free migration of your website to Lucidica</li>
          <li>Concierge - help setting up accounts, resetting password etc</li>
          <li>Platform Changes - migrate to newer servers or different tech</li>
          <li>3rd Party Liaison - we’ll talk to your web team to fix any issues</li>
          <li style="text-decoration: line-through">Dedicated Server</li>
          <li style="text-decoration: line-through">Enhanced Speed (your website supercharged speed)</li>
          <li style="text-decoration: line-through">Free SSL - add a certificate (HTTPS) from LetsEncrypt for free</li>
          <li>Website backups Monthly</li>
          <li>Additional Site 25% Discount - discount for hosting additional websites</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="offer">
        <div class="heading gold"></div>
        <div class="title">Super hosting</div>
        <p>Super hosting is on a separate server and is therefore a lot faster. Included in hosting is an hour of engineering/web development time and the hosting is completely managed by us. This is for clients that will experience a large amount of traffic and want their website to load incredibly quickly. This hosting will support a large influx of traffic.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>As you may have noticed, when you go on a website if it does not have a https url, Google will inform you
          that the website is “not secure”. Sometimes, the internet browser will even block you from entering that
          website as it is not secure. Obviously, the last thing you want is a potential customer not using you because
          your website is not secure, and they can’t find out further information. On top of that, there are a host of
          reasons why it is important to have a secure website . Therefore, we advise everyone who has a website to
          purchase and install an SSL/TLS certificate, giving you a secure website address. This is something we can do
          for you or you can do independently.</p>

        Support
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Finally, a lot of websites we create and support are based on Wordpress. So as an additional extra, we offer
          a yearly Wordpress Support package. This covers all things security, back-up and updates. This ensures that
          your website is constantly up to date and protected from online attacks. If an attack does occur, your website
          will have been automatically backed up so we can restore it easily.
