											<p>Hi! I'm Sneha, I deal with all things Business Development here at Lucidica. My job is connecting and building relationships with new clients. By understanding their specific IT needs, I can effectively provide customised contract options that pave the way for our fantastic team of engineer's to step in and work their tech magic.</p>
<p>What I love about working at Lucidica is the people. We're a diverse little bunch that work hard and play harder! The strong bond we share really translates through to our clients and we consider them just as much a part of the Lucidica family as we are.</p>
<p>Music is the longest relationship of my life and this year I fulfilled one of my life long dreams and embarked on the famed magical mystery tour to Liverpool and touched the holy ground that birthed The Beatles. It was everything I imagined and more!</p>

											<p>Hi, I'm Nick, a Business Development Executive here at Lucidica. I previously worked as a qualified psychotherapist for many years but moved to Lucidica for a career change and to develop in the world of Sales.I have always thought there were many transferable skills between therapy and sales, such as empathy, understanding, listening to problems and developing bespoke solutions with the client. I have found the transition interesting, exhilarating and am loving my new career and the challenges it brings.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I used to act at my local theatre in South London and this is something that I'd like to take up again in the future. I really enjoy live performances of any kind, especially comedy or anything a bit unusual. I like my food so to counteract that I go to the gym and have a run around my local park in Brixton. I recently passed my first motorbike test and love getting out and about in any sign of nice weather. Here is a picture of me in a play a few years ago.</p>

											<p>Hi! I'm Carolina. I am the Client Happiness Manager here at Lucidica. I know right!? What a title! My job here is to make sure clients and engineers are happy and that communication is flowing smoothly. I keep tabs on our service level and work together with the engineers to iron out any kinks and continuously improve the service level. I also check SLA's and keep in touch with clients to make sure we are meeting their expectations and delivering the tailored services we are renowned for.</p>
<p>I've come to appreciate that the important things in life are those to which we seldom give importance. Like being happy and what that means for example. For me personally, that means being with my loved ones, traveling, eating good food and indulging in music and movies that move me. Aside from all that serious stuff I am a serious dog-lover and also a big nerd.</p>
<p>That's me on my life-long dream-holiday to Japan back in 2014. That was taken at Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, it is known for its many ‘toori' (gates). Some of these date back to 711 A.D. and the shrine has over 10,000 of them. Each one donated by a business or company to thank the Fox god for plentiful business. Amazing right? Told you I was a nerd!</p>

											<p>I am an IT engineer at Lucidica. I am often on the phones, trying my hardest to help clients with their IT issues. I started working at Lucidica in April 2016 after taking on Work Experience. At Lucidica, everyone is always keen to lend a helping hand and get an issue resolved.<br />
I have been brought up around technology my whole life. I studied IT throughout my GCSE's and A-Levels at School, because it has always been a passion of mine. I am always keen to learn more, my knowledge of technology has grown dramatically since joining Lucidica.<br />
In my spare time I am a big sports fan, mainly football. I have played football since I was 8 for my local team. I did also used to play Tennis for my local club; I managed to get scouted for the Academy. However, my love for football forced me to give up my tennis career.<br />
Apart from sports, I like to spend my spare time relaxing and just enjoying life.</p>

											<p>Hey, I am an apprentice engineer at Lucidica. I'm currently working on the quick win desks, so you are likely to hear my voice and cheesy jokes when you call. I started here in April 2017, even within this small space of time, I have come an exceptional way in progressing in my IT career, not only with knowledge (already passed 2 MTA's!!) but also with how to implement my knowledge in a way that helps others.</p>
<p>The team here are like none other, not only are they professional, accomplished and highly skilled, but they also all have different vibrant unique personalities which makes Lucidica what it is; formal but fun. Not only as Lucidica the company but personally we base our successes on how happy we keep our customers and how satisfied they are with our work, which is different from most business who run a larger profit incentive company.</p>
<p>In my spare time I love to parkour and partake in high adrenaline activities, go karting, ab sailing, jet skiing, climbing. As well as this, i was in the Air Cadets where I did the loop-the-loop above a discontinued air force base.  Here's a picture of me jetskiing in Dubai (minutes before I ended up in hospital!)</p>

											<p>Hi, I'm Igor, from Lucidica's office in Kiev. I have been working for Lucidica since June 2016. My job involves resolving any technical issues that our clients have, something that I have been doing since my first computer in 1997 with a Celeron 667 MHz CPU board. Before Lucidica, I worked at a repairing center fixing any and all technology that was sent in.</p>
<p>Outside of work I love photography and traveling when I have the time. My favorite place I have ever visited has to be Berlin, I just loved Here is me with my middle-format camera called Kiev-60.</p>

											<p>I am a Marketing Associate at Lucidica, having joined as an intern in Summer 2016. I work on everything from managing social media accounts to writing content for email campaigns, websites and seminars. I love learning new things and finding out the latest marketing technique or crazy new app that can analyse another area of digital marketing.</p>
<p>Outside of work I love to travel. Anywhere and everywhere that will allow me explore, try tasty new food and perhaps see a bit of sunshine. Aside from that, I am a gin drinking, cat-obsessed country girl who is a (not so) secret history nerd.</p>
<p>This is me baby seal watching in Norwich.</p>

											<p>Hi, my name is Tanya, I work and live in Kiev. I have worked for Lucidica since November 2016, in our Ukrainian office. My duties surround handling the Lucidica branch here in Ukraine. I also help remotely with day to day tasks in the London office.</p>
<p>In Kiev I try to make sure everything works smoothly and in a timely manner. I like everything being in its places and being where it should be! I manage human resources, spending a proportion of my time on the happiness of the team and how I can motivate them. The Kiev office has its own western-European beauty and charm, we are always happy to help you!</p>
<p>My passion is tourism. Any time I can, I try to spend it outside;  in my kayak on the river, in the woods or climbing the mountains. Here is my kayaking below.</p>

											<p>I started life at Lucidica back in August 2014. I work to make sure that the team are happy &amp; that we are all keeping up our high standards in both London &amp; Kiev. I also look after recruitment, HR and finance as well as working alongside the divisional managers to ensure each area of the business is performing well.</p>
<p>I love to snowboard but sadly I don't spend nearly as much time in the Alps as I would like to. I live in sunny Sussex with my boyfriend but love London so the commute is no problem. I also love all food, baking, and festivals.</p>
<p>This is me very excited to have a ticket for a helicopter ride in the Alps.</p>
