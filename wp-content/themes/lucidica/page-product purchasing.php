  <section class="section section-item section__webdev">
    <p>The main components of a business’s IT setup are computers, laptops and various hardware items that are essential
      for a business to function. We know that it is all too easy to jump on Amazon and get the latest technology in a
      click of a button and receive it the next day. However, we’ve found from experience that normally isn’t the best
      idea unless you are up to date with all the latest tech developments, hardware and software knowledge and are able
      to pick an affordable product that also has long term benefits. </p>
