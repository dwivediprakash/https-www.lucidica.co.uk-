            <h3>How does the service desk work?</h3>
            <div>
                When you call you will speak with one of the engineers on the Quick Win Desk. S/he will log your job or take a look at the issue. If the job is urgent please highlight this to the engineer when you call. We aim to start quick win jobs immediately. Quick win jobs are jobs that take 20 minutes or less. Some examples include: password resets, email forwards and adding out of office messages etc.  If not, it will be passed on to the most appropriate engineer who will start the job within your service level agreement.
            </div>
            <h3>How quick is your response time?</h3>
            <div>
                The service level agreement is the part of your contract agreement with Lucidica. This defines what you provide and what you can expect regarding our response rates. As a rule of thumb we action these jobs sooner than the SLA dictates but the timeframe above gives you an indication of what is outlined in your contract.
            </div>
            <h3>How proactive are Lucidica with communication?</h3>
            <div>
                Once the job is started, the engineer will keep you updated on it’s progress. When finished they will confirm with you and close the job.  We also survey 25% of closed jobs for customer service satisfaction to ensure that we are upholding our standards.  In addition, all of our contract clients are assigned an account engineer, it is their responsibility to oversee the overall health of a client’s account and systems. This includes having an overview of the technology used, how you work, up and coming changes and any service feedback. Depending on your contract they will consult with you bi-annually/annually to develop a long term IT strategy and suggest solutions that will improve your overall IT environment.
            </div>
            <h3>How much does an IT support contract cost?</h3>
            <div>
                Prices vary massively dependent on how big your company is and what level of support you require. Before we can give you an accurate quote we need to know a little bit more about you to get a better understanding of how you and your business works to tailor the quote to your specific needs.
            </div>
            <h3>Do you have 24/7 IT support?</h3>
            <div>
                We do have an on-call engineer 24/7 for remote support. However, calling out of hours does incur a surcharge.
