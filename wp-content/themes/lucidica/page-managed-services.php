			<p>The way businesses use IT are always changing and especially smaller businesses are moving to monthly managed services for infrastructure, back-up and cybersecurity. This service means that you pay a monthly, occasionally yearly, cost which can constantly be adapted to your needs and your business growth. We also manage this service for you so any new users, extra mailboxes or increased storage- we’ve got you covered.</p>
			<p>We use a host of different vendors to supply our customers with the highest quality managed services. We’ve personally tested, completed competitor research and trained our engineers in the services we use so that we can support you in the best way possible. Like our products service, we are technically agnostic so we have no Google vs Microsoft bias, we support both and we advise based on your technical requirements.</p>
			<p><strong>Below is a brief overview of what we provide and different ways we can support your business: </strong></p>

	</div>
</div>
<div class="wrapper section-content">
	<div class="section-item" style="border-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; margin: 0 auto;">
		<p>Google Suite provides you with emails addresses, video/voice conferencing, secure team messaging and shared calendars.</p>
		<p>You also get web-based productivity tools to enable you to create documents, spreadsheets and presentations. This is were Google is the master, real-time collaboration is what Google’s is all about, sharing docs with internal or external users is easy.</p>
		<p>You also get companywide Gmail and GDrive search (Google knows all about search!)</p>
		<p>For a little bit more money you also get Data loss prevention tools to make sure that your data is where it should be and access to audit logs so that you can see who has accessed what and be able to search all elements of your company’s Google suite. You can setup auto archiving and retention on your files.</p>

		<h2 class="section-item-title" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">Microsoft suite</h2>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="wrapper section-content">
	<div class="section-item" style="border-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; margin: 0 auto;">
		<p>Microsoft provides a similar service to Google with user emails addresses, video/voice conferencing, secure team messaging and shared calendars, but with the power of Exchange for seamless syncing between all devices.</p>
		<p>You also get web-based or local productivity tools (Excel, Word, Outlook and PowerPoint) to enable you to create documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Microsoft also has their own real-time collaboration tools and now with Windows 10 sharing docs with internal or external users is easy.</p>
		<p>You also get companywide search with Delve and can use Skype for business as your IP phone PBX and Microsoft Teams as a slack competitor.</p>
		<p>SharePoint is usually an untapped resource that you get for free, most use it just for storage, but it is can be transformed into a very power CRM, holiday booking system, supplier list or even product inventory and tracking system, the world is your oyster when it comes to SharePoint.</p>
		<p>For a little bit more, money you also get Data loss prevention tools to make sure that your data is where it should be, you also get access to audit logs so that you can see who has accessed what and with EMS you can secure your files against unauthorised access even if you can’t access the file.</p>

		<h2 class="section-item-title" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">Backup, DR and Business Continuity</h2>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="wrapper section-content">
	<div class="section-item" style="border-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; margin: 0 auto;">
		<p>Backup is a place in time snapshot of your data that can be used to look at data as it was in a previous time period. A good back up strategy is to have your data backed up in 3 different medias in 3 different locations. With the advent of cloud storage, having your data with 2 cloud providers with 1 having the ability to recover all data at various points in time is enough as most cloud providers have their data in multiple physical locations.</p>
		<p>If you have tour data inhouse then you but having at the very least onsite and offsite backups.</p>
		<p>DR or Disaster Recovery, is something that usually gets forgotten, if you have a major disaster or outage, what is the plan to get you back up and running? Should your users work from home, or even a starbucks? Business continuity also comes into this, with so many clients in the cloud for their email services what would happen is Gmail or Office 365 went down, would you just wait for it to come back up or would you be able to failover to another service and then fail back once all is working again?</p>

</div>
<div class="wrapper section-content">
	<div class="section-item" style="border-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; margin: 0 auto;">
		<p>No matter where you are, you are open to attack, open up some ports on your firewall and you will see within minutes someone trying to access your network. We have all seen spam email trying to get us to sign into a fake website so that they can get our credentials. Phishing attacks via email are ten a penny, so you have to protect yourself, a mixture of user training, rock solid anti-spam and threat detection services will make sure you and your users won’t fall victim and end up sending money to rouge players by mistake or due to your data getting encrypted.</p>
		<p>GDPR is the current buzz word, with hefty fines if you have no processes in place, you need to make sure you know where your data is at any point and be able to delete when requested. SharePoint and Office 365 EMS can help you organize and protect your data so that it is searchable, retrievable and protected at all times.</p>
